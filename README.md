# Information

This library provides common type definitions defined in the [JSON-RPC 2.0] specification.

It aims to be as unopinionated as possible, and only provides the bare minimum to be compliant with the standard. Specifically, *transport* is not included. Serialization can be optionally enabled with the `serde` feature.
